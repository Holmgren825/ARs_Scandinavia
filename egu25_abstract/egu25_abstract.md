# EGU 2025 Abstract to Atmospheric river session
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) have an important role in the global climate system, facilitating both meridional moisture transport and regional weather patterns important in the local water supply. 
While there is extensive research on the relationship between ARs and precipitation in North America, where ARs contribute up to 50% of California's annual precipitation, and East Asia, where ARs affect floods in the Yangtze River Basin, the role of ARs in the regional climate of Scandinavia remains understudied.

In this study we have used the results from four AR Detection and Tracking algorithms (ARDTs), part of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP), to characterize ARs making landfall over Scandinavia.
Combined with ERA5 reanalysis precipitation data, we could quantify the AR related precipitation over the region.
We found that ARs are present during up to 35% of the total annual precipitation, with the average AR-associated rainfall rate exceeding the non-AR rates by \~36%.

By clustering the individual ARs using a K-Means algorithm, we found four AR intersection patterns over Scandinavia: two over southern Sweden and Denmark, one centred over western Norway, and one over the central, interior, parts of Sweden and Norway.
The two southern clusters exhibit the highest annual frequencies, ~10% of the time each, and together they account for ~32% of the total annual precipitation.
ARs in the cluster over western Norway have an annual frequency of \~6.4%, and contribute to \~9% of the annual precipitation.
Least frequent are ARs in the central, interior, cluster with annual frequencies \~2.7%, and a contribution of \~4% of the annual precipitation.

Furthermore, we found that the AR frequency varied depending on the season and phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
For instance, ARs in one of the southern clusters were equally frequent during all seasons except March-April-May, whereas ARs activity in the second southern cluster peaked during September-October-November.
Additionally, despite the differences in the relationship between AR frequency and the phase of the NAO among the clusters, AR activity generally peaks during strong positive phases (>0.5) of the NAO.
