# EGU 2025 Abstract to Atmospheric river session
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play an important role in the global climate system, with multiple studies previously exploring the relationship between ARs and precipitation in for instance North America and East Asia.
However, the role of ARs in the regional climate of Scandinavia is less well understood.
We have used the results from four AR detection and tracking algorithms (ARDTs), part of the ARTMIP project, along with ERA5 reanalysis data, to characterize the spatial and temporal distributions of ARs making landfall over Scandinavia, and their associated precipitation.
We found that ARs are present during up to 35% of the total precipitation in an average year over Scandinavia.
Furthermore, by clustering the individual ARs using a K-Means algorithm, we found four clusters of ARs that intersect Scandinavia: two over the southern Sweden and Denmark, one over the middle west-cost of Norway, and one cluster located over the central parts of Sweden and Norway.
The southern clusters exhibit the highest annual frequencies, ~10% of the time each, and are both related to ~16% of the total annual precipitation.
The ARs in the cluster over western Norway exhibit annual frequencies \~6.4%, and are related to \~9% of the annual precipitation.
ARs in central cluster are the least frequent, with annual frequencies \~2.7%, and are related to \~4% of the annual precipitation.
The AR frequency over Scandinavia varied depending on the cluster, season, and phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
For instance, ARs in one of the southern clusters were equally frequent during all seasons except March-April-May, whereas ARs in the second southern cluster were the most frequent during September-October-November.
Additionally, despite that there are clear differences in the relationship between AR frequency and the phase of the NAO among the clusters, ARs are most frequent during strong positive phases (>0.5) of the NAO.

- Maybe something on differences between NAO response: equal-ish for southern clusters, but very skewed for northern cluster.
