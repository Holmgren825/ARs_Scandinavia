# EGU 2025 Abstract to Atmospheric river session
Atmospheric rivers (ARs) play an important role in both the global and regional climate systems.
While there is extensive research on ARs, and their relationship to precipitation, in North America and East Asia, the role of ARs in the regional climate of Scandinavia remains understudied.

In this study, we have investigated the characteristics of ARs making landfall over Scandinavia, their influence on local precipitation, and how they are affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
To achieve this, we have analysed the ARs between 1980 and 2019 detected by four different AR Detection and Tracking algorithms (ARDTs), part of the Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP).
Combined with ERA5 reanalysis precipitation data, we have quantified the AR related precipitation over the region.

We found that ARs are present during up to 35% of the total annual precipitation, with the average AR-associated rainfall rate exceeding the non-AR rates.
Clustering the ARs that intersect Scandinavia revealed four main AR patterns.
For the two most frequent patterns, located in southern Scandinavia, ARs account for up to 32% of the total annual precipitation.
Furthermore, for all patterns, AR activity reaches a maximum during autumn or whilst the NAO is in a strong positive phase.
