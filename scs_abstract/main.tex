In this poster, we will show some early results from our current study focusing on atmospheric rivers (ARs) over Scandinavia.
Atmospheric rivers are long and narrow filaments with unusually high quantities of tropospheric moisture transport.
Previous research has extensively studied the impacts of atmospheric rivers on the regional climate and extreme precipitation events in North America and East Asia, but how they affect climate and weather variability over Scandinavia is less well understood.
Here, we have used a state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithm on ERA5 reanalysis data to identify atmospheric rivers that make landfall over Scandinavia.
First, the algorithm identifies AR features using techniques borrowed from image analysis.
Based on the intensity and direction of the moisture transport in these features, we then compute the AR centrelines.
The centrelines are used to provide key characteristics of the ARs, such as length, shape, and the location of termination.
Through the examination of their spatial patterns, frequency and seasonal variability, we aim to increase the understanding of how atmospheric rivers influence the Scandinavian climate, specifically the role atmospheric rivers play in regional precipitation.
