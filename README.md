# Characteristics of Atmospheric Rivers over Scandinavia and their influence on precipitation

Scripts, Notebooks, code, manuscript source code and other things.

Analysis code is located in the folder `analysis`.
The full analysis can be run with the script `run_analysis.sh`.
This requires an python environment `ar_ident` with the packages defined in `requirements.txt` install.
Additionally, the bundled python package `ar_scandinavia` needs to be installed.
This is most easily installed with `pip install -e .` in the root folder of this project.
